    <string name="cities_delhi_address">66km (1h 40m) from Rohtak</string>
    <string name="cities_delhi_description">New Delhi is the capital of India and one of Delhi
        city\'s 11 districts. The foundation stone of the city was laid by George V, Emperor of
        India during the Delhi Durbar of 1911. It was designed by British architects, Sir Edwin
        Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker. The new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931, by
        Viceroy and Governor-General of India Lord Irwin.
        \n\nAlthough colloquially Delhi and New Delhi as names are used interchangeably to refer to
        the jurisdiction of the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, these are two distinct
        entities, and the latter is a small part of the former. New Delhi has been selected as one
        of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi\'s
        flagship Smart Cities Mission.</string>

    <string name="cities_chandigarh_name">Chandigarh</string>
    <string name="cities_chandigarh_address">240km (3h 30m) from Rohtak</string>
    <string name="cities_chandigarh_description">Chandigarh is a city and a union territory of
        India that serves as the capital of the Indian states of Punjab and Haryana. As a union
        territory, the city is governed directly by the Union Government and is not part of either
        state.
        \n\nChandigarh is bordered by the state of Punjab to the north, west and south, and to the
        state of Haryana to the east. Chandigarh is considered to be a part of the Chandigarh
        capital region or Greater Chandigarh, which includes Chandigarh, and the cities of Mohali,
        Zirakpur, Kharar, Kurali (in Punjab) and the city of Panchkula (in Haryana).
        \n\nChandigarh was one of the early planned cities in the post-independence India and is
        internationally known for its architecture and urban design. The master plan of the
        city was prepared by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, which transformed from earlier
        plans created by the Polish architect Maciej Nowicki and the American planner Albert Mayer.
        Most of the government buildings and housing in the city, were designed by the Chandigarh
        Capital Project Team headed by Le Corbusier, Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry. In 2015, an
        article published by BBC named Chandigarh as one of the perfect cities of the world in
        terms of architecture, cultural growth and modernisation.
        \n\nChandigarh‚Äôs Capitol Complex was in July 2016 declared by UNESCO as World Heritage at
        the 40th session of World Heritage Conference held in Istanbul. UNESCO inscription was
        under \"The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier an outstanding contribution to the
        Modern Movement\". The Capitol Complex buildings include the Punjab and Haryana High
        Court, Punjab and Haryana Secretariat and Punjab and Haryana Assembly along with monuments
        Open hand, Martyrs Memorial, Geometric Hill and Tower of Shadow.
        \n\nThe city was reported to be the cleanest in India in 2010, based on a national
        government study. In 2016, Chandigarh was declared as the second cleanest city of India
        under Swachh Bharat Survekshan. Chandigarh is also known to be the first smoke-free city
        in India.</string>


    <string name="cities_gurgaon_name">Gurgaon</string>
    <string name="cities_gurgaon_address">84km (1h 54m) from Rohtak</string>
    <string name="cities_gurgaon_description">Gurgaon, officially known as Gurugram, is a city in
        the Indian state of Haryana and is located near the National Capital Region of India. It
        is 32 kilometres (20 mi) southwest of New Delhi and 268 kilometres (167 mi) southwest of
        Chandigarh, the state capital. As of 2011, Gurgaon had a population of 876,824.
        \n\nWitnessing rapid urbanization, Gurgaon has become a leading financial and industrial
        hub with the third highest per capita income in India. Historically known as Gurugram, the
        city\'s economic growth story started when the leading Indian automobile manufacturer Maruti
        Suzuki India Limited established a manufacturing plant in Gurgaon in the 1970s. Today,
        Gurgaon has local offices for more than 250 Fortune 500 companies.</string>

    <string name="cities_kurukshetra_name">Kurukshetra</string>
    <string name="cities_kurukshetra_address">150km (2h 14m) from Rohtak</string>
    <string name="cities_kurukshetra_description">Kurukshetra is a city in the state of Haryana,
        India. It is also known as Dharmakshetra (\"Holy Place\"). According to the
        Puranas, Kurukshetra is a region named after King Kuru, the ancestor of Kauravas and
        Pandavas, as depicted in epic Mahabharata. The importance of the place is attributed to
        the fact that the Kurukshetra War of the Mahabharata was fought on this land and the
        Bhagavad Gita was preached here during the war when Lord Krishna found Arjuna in a
        terrible dilemma.
        \n\nBefore the establishment of a refugee camp named Kurukshetra in 1947, Thanesar was the
        name of the tehsil headquarters and the town. Thanesar or Sthaneswar is a historical town
        located adjacent to what is now the newly created Kurukshetra city. Thanesar derives its
        name from the word \"Sthaneshwar\", which means \"Place of God\". The
        Sthaneshwar Mahadev Temple, whose presiding deity is Lord Shiva, is believed to be the
        oldest temple in the vicinity. Local hearsay identifies the legendary
        \"Kurukshetra\" with a place near Thanesar. A few kilometers from Kurukshetra
        is the village known as Amin, where there are remnants of a fort which is believed to be
        Abhimanyu\'s.
        \n\nIn most ancient Hindu texts, Kurukshetra is not a city but a region. The boundaries of
        Kurukshetra correspond roughly to the central and western parts of state of Haryana and
        southern Punjab. Thus according to the Taittiriya Aranyaka, the Kurukshetra region is
        south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh in Sirhind, Punjab), north of Khandava (Delhi and Mewat
        region), east of Maru (desert) and west of Parin.
        \n\nIn early July 2013 the Haryana Department of Archaeology and Museums announced that
        the earlier excavated remains of a Buddhist stupa in Kurukshetra were ready to be displayed
        for the public.</string>
